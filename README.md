# GitHub Reverse Branches

Simple Chrome extension reversing `base` and `compare` branches on click while creating a pull request on GitHub.

Based on [this boilerplate](https://github.com/virejdasani/Chrome-Extension-Boilerplate).

[Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7F8sppax54&ab_channel=Virej) video to learn how to install it from package.

## TODO

- [ ] Rewrite to Manifest V3
- [ ] Support for automaticly detecting main branch in the repository (now it's hardcoded `main`)
- [ ] Publish in Chrome market
